Another way to calculate the value of "e" in Python is to use the fact that "e" is the limit of the expression:

bash

(1 + 1/n)^n
as n approaches infinity. We can use this fact to calculate an approximation of "e" by choosing a large value of n and computing the expression:

python

def calculate_euler():
    n = 1000000
    euler = (1 + 1/n) ** n
    return euler
In this code, we are choosing n to be a large number (in this case, 1 million), and computing the expression (1 + 1/n)^n to approximate the value of "e". This method can be less computationally intensive than the previous method, as it only requires one calculation instead of a loop. However, the accuracy of this method depends on the value of n chosen, and a larger value of n may be required to obtain a more accurate approximation.





import math

def calculate_euler():
    e = 1
    factorial = 1
    n = 1
    while True:
        factorial *= n
        term = 1/factorial
        e += term
        n += 1
        if math.isclose(term, 0, rel_tol=1e-16):
            break
    return e

euler = calculate_euler()
print(euler)



To calculate the Euler's number "e" in Python without using the Sympy library, you can use the following code:

python

import math

def calculate_euler():
    e = 1
    factorial = 1
    n = 1
    while True:
        factorial *= n
        term = 1/factorial
        e += term
        n += 1
        if math.isclose(term, 0, rel_tol=1e-16):
            break
    return e

euler = calculate_euler()
print(euler)
In this code, we are using the Taylor series to approximate the value of "e". The Taylor series for "e" is:

makefile

e = 1 + 1/1! + 1/2! + 1/3! + ...
We can calculate the value of "e" by computing the terms in the series until the difference between two consecutive terms is very small (i.e., less than a certain tolerance level). In this code, we are using a relative tolerance of 1e-16 to determine when to stop calculating terms.

Note that the math.isclose() function is used to compare the difference between two consecutive terms to zero. This is because comparing floating-point numbers for equality can be problematic due to rounding errors. The math.isclose() function takes into account the magnitude of the numbers being compared, so it is a more reliable way to check if two floating-point numbers are close to each other.
